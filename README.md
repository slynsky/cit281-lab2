## Lab Purpose and Components
The purpose of lab 2 was to cursorily famiarize students with using git in the command terminal.

## What I Learned
This lab basically just expanded on the preliminary understanding of the command line I acheived in the previous lab. It was also the first introduction to git, which was an important foundational piece, as we used git throughout the rest of the term.
